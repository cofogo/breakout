BACKLOG
=======
- [ ] implement the second paddle
- [ ] change round loss condition to no balls left, to support multiple balls
- [ ] implement last player hit tracking on ball (probs pass ID)
- [ ] improve game over screen with animations, scoreboard, wait for input to q
- [ ] add error handling when opening fonts (e.g. open fornts from Text_Object)
- [ ] reevaluate if text_to_texture should be in utils namespace as there is a wrapper class (Text_Object) for that now
- [ ] improve collisions with a trajectory intercept mechanism, account for multiple collisions per frame

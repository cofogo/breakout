[NEW SESSION] : 2016-12-26[19:14:42]Monday
[19:14:57] Implemented a very basic engine and the paddle object. Still need to 
limit the framerate properly and tidy up the code.

[11:48:05] improved code structure and optimised a bit.
- Implemented the brick object and got some bricks to render.
- Created some placeholder graphics for bricks and balls.

[NEW SESSION] : 2017-01-06[14:11:58]Friday
[14:12:17] Implemented ball, calculating directional speed by bounce angle.
Prety neat, but will gave to use floating point, as now some speed is lost due
to precision (full pixels only).

[18:38:05] implemented basig box-box collision detection.
[18:38:30] tried out several approaches to collision detection and then(should h
ave done this first) done some extensive research.
[18:39:51] implemented collision handling that does not work. Will have to rewri
te.

[21:52:36] One of the dirtiest code examples was produced today... It kind-of
works, but just as a place-holder.
--- TODO - Remove dirty code ---
- FIX ball class so internal functions only do what they are supposed to do.
- FIX texture handling, so that they can be shared.
- FIX collision detection logic, to also handle the paddle.

[22:03:12] On the up side though, we have a ball that
handles collisions correctly ~90 percent of the time.
And bricks do get destroyed when hit by the ball.

[08:05:23] got stuck implementing shared textures... learning about smart
pointers and writing code that segfaults on vector.push_back() xD

implementing the shared texture handling system.

[08:08:16] implemented bounce off ange dependency based on paddle collision loca
tion. But its bugged at the moment, no time to fix now - tomorrow maybe.

[19:48:22] fixed the ball->paddle collisions. Now the game has become so much 
more fun as the player can actually have an immense influence on the trajectory
of the ball.

[19:14:57] Implemented a very basic engine and the paddle object. Still need to 
limit the framerate properly and tidy up the code.

[14:12:17] Implemented ball, calculating directional speed by bounce angle.
Prety neat, but will gave to use floating point, as now some speed is lost due
to precision (full pixels only).

[18:38:30] tried out several approaches to collision detection and then(should h
ave done this first) done some extensive research.
[18:39:51] implemented collision handling that does not work. Will have to rewri
te.

[21:52:36] One of the dirtiest code examples was produced today... It kind-of
works, but just as a place-holder.
--- TODO - Remove dirty code ---
- FIX ball class so internal functions only do what they are supposed to do.
- FIX texture handling, so that they can be shared.
- FIX collision detection logic, to also handle the paddle.

[22:03:12] On the up side though, we have a ball that
handles collisions correctly ~90 percent of the time.
And bricks do get destroyed when hit by the ball.

DEVELOPMENT RULES

Some basic guidelines/

TOOLS
-----
- Use whatever you like, just do not clutter the repo with files and/or folders generated by IDE's and such.
- Use of free software (GNU/Linux, GNU compiler collection, etc...) is recommended and commendable.

CODING
------
- STYLE - for conformity, lets do our best to adhere to the "Stroustrup style" and fall in line with what is allready written for the project.
- DEPENDENCIES - it is planned that the project will use SDL2 main and supporting libraries (SDL2_ttf, SDL2_image, etc.), please do not add anything else without informing others and receiving confirmation that majority vote is in your favour.

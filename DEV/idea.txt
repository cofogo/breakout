BREAKOUT FOR TWO
================

PROJECT
-------
The breakout for two project is a game development training exercice with the goal to make something possibly usefull and/or fun along the way.

GAME
----
The twist on the tried and true formula is that there are two players - one at the top and one at the bottom. When a ball hits a brick, the score is counted towards the player whose paddle last touched the ball.

Who gets the ball first? - both players, the game starts with two balls.

ADDITIONAL IDEAS
----------------
Tint the playing balls with the colour of the player whose paddle last touched the ball.
